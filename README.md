## INSTALLATION

Soon will be available from CPAN.

To install this module from source type the following:

```shell
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
```

To avoid installing to a system directory, you can change the installation
prefix at Makefile.PL time with

```shell
perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/other/place
```

This will install the module to the subdirectory lib/perl5 under the given
prefix.  If this is not already in perl's include path, you'll need to tell
perl how to get to this library directory so you can use it; there are three
ways:

* in your environment (the easiest):

```shell
PERL5LIB=/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl
export PERL5LIB
```

* on the perl command line:

```shell
perl -I /some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl yourscript
```

* in the code of your perl script:

```shell
use lib '/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl';
```

To build the documentation as html, run:

```shell
make html
```
